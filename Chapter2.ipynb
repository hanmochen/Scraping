    "\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look for a “Print This Page” link, or perhaps a mobile version of the site that has better-formatted HTML\n",
    "- Look for the information hidden in a JavaScript file.\n",
    "- This is more common for page titles, but the information might be available in the URL of the page itself.\n",
    "- If the information you are looking for is unique to this website for some reason, you’re out of luck. If not, try to think of other sources you could get this information from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially when faced with buried or poorly formatted data, it’s important not to just start digging and write yourself into a hole that you might not be able to get out of. Take a deep breath and think of alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re certain no alternatives exist, the rest of this chapter explains standard and creative ways of selecting tags based on their position, context, attributes, and contents. The techniques presented here, when used correctly, will go a long way toward writing more stable and reliable web crawlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Another Serving of `BeautifulSoup`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll discuss searching for tags by attributes, working with lists of tags, and navigating parse trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly every website you encounter contains stylesheets. Although you might think that a layer of styling on websites that is designed specifically for browser and human interpretation might be a bad thing, the advent of CSS is a boon for web scrapers. CSS relies on the differentiation of HTML elements that might otherwise have the exact same markup in order to style them differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because CSS relies on these identifying attributes to style sites appropriately, you are almost guaranteed that these class and ID attributes will be plentiful on most modern websites.\n",

    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup’s find() and find_all() are the two functions you will likely use the most. \n",

    "```python\n",
    "find_all(tag, attributes, recursive, text, limit, keywords) \n",
    "find(tag, attributes, recursive, text, keywords)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In all likelihood, 95% of the time you will need to use only the first two arguments: `tag` and `attributes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tag` argument is one that you’ve seen before; you can pass a string name of a tag or even a Python list of string tag names. For example, the following returns a list of all the header tags in a document: \n",
    "```python\n",
    ".find_all(['h1','h2','h3','h4','h5','h6'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `attributes` argument takes a Python dictionary of attributes and matches tags that contain any one of those attributes. For example, the following function would return both the green and red span tags in the HTML document:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ".find_all('span', {'class':{'green', 'red'}})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `recursive` argument is a boolean. How deeply into the document do you want to go? If `recursive` is set to `True`, the `find_all` function looks into children, and children’s children, for tags that match your parameters. If it is `False`, it will look only at the top-level tags in your document. By default, `find_all` works recursively (recursive is set to True); it’s generally a good idea to leave this as is, unless you really know what you need to do and performance is an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `text` argument is unusual in that it matches based on the text content of the tags, rather than properties of the tags themselves."

    "The keyword argument can be helpful in some situations. However, it is technically redundant as a BeautifulSoup feature.For instance, the following two lines are identical:\n",

    "bs.find_all(id='text') \n",
    "bs.find_all('', {'id':'text'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "In addition, you might occasionally run into problems using `keyword,` most notably when searching for elements by their `class` attribute, because `class` is a protected keyword in Python. That is, class is a reserved word in Python that cannot be used as a variable or argument name. For example, if you try the following call, you’ll get a syntax error due to the nonstandard use of class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bs.find_all(class='green')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instead, you can use BeautifulSoup’s somewhat clumsy solution, which involves adding an underscore:\n",

    "### Other BeautifulSoup Objects\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- `BeautifulSoup` objects \n",
    "- `Tag` objects\n",
    "    Retrieved in lists, or retrieved individually by calling `find` and `find_all` on a `BeautifulSoup` object, or drilling down, as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bs.div.h1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are two more objects in the library that, although less commonly used, are still important to know about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NavigableString` objects\n",
    "    Used to represent text within tags, rather than the tags themselves (some functions operate on and produce NavigableStrings, rather than tag objects).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `Comment` object \n",
    "    Used to find HTML comments in comment tags, `<!--like this one-->`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Navigating Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find_all` function is responsible for finding tags based on their name and attributes. But what if you need to find a tag based on its location in a document? That’s where tree navigation comes in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dealing with children and other descendants\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `BeautifulSoup` library, as well as many other libraries, there is a distinction drawn between children and descendants: much like in a human family tree, children are always exactly one tag below a parent, whereas descendants can be at any level in the tree below a parent. **All children are descendants, but not all descendants are children.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, BeautifulSoup functions always deal with the descendants of the current tag selected. For instance, bs.body.h1 selects the first h1 tag that is a descendant of the body tag. It will not find tags located outside the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, bs.div.find_all('img') will find the first div tag in the document, and then retrieve a list of all img tags that are descendants of that div tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to find only descendants that are children, you can use the .children tag:"

    "1. Write the letter a at least once.\n",
    "2. Append to this the letter b exactly five times.\n",
    "3. Append to this the letter c any even number of times.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `aa*`: The letter a is written, followed by a* (read as a star), which means “any number of as, including 0 of them.” In this way, you can guarantee that the letter a is written at least once.\n",
    "- `bbbbb`: No special effects here—just five bs in a row.\n",
    "- `(cc)*`: Any even number of things can be grouped into pairs, so in order to enforce this rule about even things, you can write two cs, surround them in parentheses, and write an asterisk after it, meaning that you can have any number of pairs of cs\n",
    "- `(d|e)`: Adding a bar in the middle of two expressions means that it can be “this thing or that thing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "> The standard version of regular expressions (the one covered in this book and used by Python and BeautifulSoup) is based on syntax used by Perl. Most modern programming languages use this or one similar to it. Be aware, however, that if you are using regular expressions in another language, you might encounter problems. Even some modern languages, such as Java, have slight differences in the way they handle regular expressions.\n",

Certainly, you can’t count on the only images on the page being product images.\n",

For instance, a featured product image might appear in a special layout at the top of some pages, but not others.\n",
